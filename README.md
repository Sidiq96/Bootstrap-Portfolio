# Bootstrap-Portfolio
## Description

In this assignment, I'll be building my portfolio layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework from scratch. An effective portfolio highlights my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can’t be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.
